                <p>Apple Vision Pro comprises approximately 300 components.[40] It has a curved laminated glass display on the front, an aluminum frame on its sides, a flexible cushion on the inside, and a removable, adjustable headband. The frame contains five sensors, six microphones, and 12 cameras. </p>

                <img src="./women.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>Apple Vision Pro received mixed to positive reviews. Nilay Patel of The Verge praised the headset's design as being more premium and less "goofy"-looking than other existing VR headsets, felt that its displays were "generally incredible" in their sharpness and brightness, it had the highest-quality video passthrough he had seen on an MR headset yet (even while having a field of view narrower than the Meta Quest 3), and that its speakers had a "convincing" spatial audio effect.</p>

                <p>Most reviews from buyers of Apple Vision Pro were also mixed to positive. While many users on Reddit seemed very satisfied with the device and entranced with the concept of a spatial computer, others lamented the small field of view or lack of common VR qualities.

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p class="card-text">Fascinatingly though, Vision Pro's narrow field of view is actually the fault of the thickness of the light seal, otherwise known as the facial interface. You can technically wear Vision Pro without a light seal, though Apple doesn't recommend it and it hurts your nose too much to be practical. Without the light seal, Vision Pro's field of view feels just a few degrees narrower than Quest 3.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p class="card-text">As for the actual battery life, I consistently got around the 2 hours advertised, though you can connect USB-C power to the battery for indefinite use, and this is how I spent the majority of my time in Vision Pro. Given this and the product’s seated focus, I find the popular complaints about battery life, mostly coming from those who don’t actually own the headset, to be overblown.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="card">

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p class="card-text">Whatever your view on this, Apple chose the tethered battery approach, at least for its first-generation headset. And that means that every time you go to use Vision Pro you have to consciously think about how to best position this 353 gram anchor, around double the weight of a typical smartphone, and how to keep the cable out of the way of your left arm. And if you want to stand up or even just adjust your seating position, you better make sure the battery is in your pocket or held it in your hand.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="card">

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p class="card-text">I've snagged the cable. I've knocked the battery off my chair, uncomfortably tugging the headset. And I've leaned too far to the right and hit the tether's limit. The battery tether feels ever-present, and because it's so short it's much more annoying than the long tether of PC VR headsets or PlayStation VR2. I've picked up Quest 3 frequently in the past few days as a point of comparison to Vision Pro, and it's incredibly refreshing being able to just put the headset on your head and move however you like, no forethought required.</p>
